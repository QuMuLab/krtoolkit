# KR Toolkit

Various libraries to help with common AI research in knowledge representation and reasoning.

## Disclaimer
The KR Toolkit was written in a time where much of its functionality didn't exist. The future of the library is to branch out the useful and unique contributions into their own libraries, and let the entire library be deprecated. For archival purposes, the list of [issues](https://github.com/QuMuLab/krtoolkit/issues) and main [wiki pages](https://github.com/QuMuLab/krtoolkit/wiki) have been ported from the original repository on BitBucket. If you are interested in any aspect of the functionality, [let me know](http://www.haz.ca/).
